This repository contains code for the models presented in the [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48791-1_17).

The code base is built using the [Spectral Python](http://www.spectralpython.net/), [Numpy] (https://numpy.org/) and [Scikit-Learn] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries. The GMLC based model is implemented through the Spectral Python library whereas the CNN based model is implemented using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library. The code is provided in the form of a jupyter notebook which can be run on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

The experiments have been carried out as described in the paper for the following datasets:

1) Indian Pines dataset
2) Pavia University dataset
